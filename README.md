# Pokemon-Viewer Application (SwiftUI)

Pokemon-viewer is an application for the mobile operating system IOS 16.2 and above. The main functionality of the application is to get a list of Pokemon from a remote server (<a href="https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon">API</a>) through the Internet connection. There is an ability to view detailed information on each of the obtained pokemons. 
The application provides for handling any errors received during the program operation (example: server errors, no Internet connection, and data decoding errors).
And there is also an individual color theme (dark neon, and light) depending on the selected color theme on the user's device.
